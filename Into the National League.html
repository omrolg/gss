    <h1><strong>Into the National League: 1959</strong></h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Türkiye Profesyonel 1. Ligi (today it is organized with the name Süper Lig) formed in 1959, just after the foundation of UEFA in 1954. This is the top-flight professional league in Turkish nationwide football, and the most popular sporting competition in the country. The 1959 Milli Lig (National League) was the first season of professional football in Turkey. The league was made up of sixteen clubs split into two groups: the Kırmızı Grup (Red Group) and Beyaz Grup (White Group), the colours of the Turkish flag. The first season took place in the calendar year of 1959, instead of 1958–59, because the qualifying stages took place in 1958. The final consisted of two legs and took place between the winners of each group. Galatasaray won the Kırmızı Grup and Fenerbahçe won the Beyaz Grup. Galatasaray won the first match 1–0. Metin Oktay scored the goal and the ball ripped the net, but Fenerbahçe won the second 4–0, winning 4–1 on aggregate. Metin Oktay finished top scorer with 11 goals. Although Metin Oktay became Gol Kralı in 1960 and 1961, the club could not win the league, finishing 3rd in 1960 and 2nd in 1961.</li>
