    <h1><strong>Bad years (1932–1948)</strong></h1>
    <ul>
      <li>After a dispute about amateurism-professionalism between Galatasaray SK members in 1933, the group which favored a more professional club left Galatasaray SK and founded the Güneş SK. Thanks to financial and political power the new club was able to sign the best players of Galatasaray SK and the fall of Galatasaray SK begun. Between 1932 and 1949 the club could not win the Istanbul League. In 1933 Galatasray SK won the Istanbul Shield and in 1939 the Milli Küme. Not only the football team was in a crisis however, as the whole club was in a chaotic situation. Between 1930–1941 there had been fifteen presidents and ten managers.
      Star player Nihat Bekdik quit in 1936, though a new star joined in 1934, Gündüz Kılıç. Thanks to both players the club were runners up of the Istanbul Football League in 1934–1935 and 1935–1936. With Kiliç the club won the Istanbul Cup in 1942 and 1943 and were runners up of the Istanbul Football League in 1941–1942.</li>
